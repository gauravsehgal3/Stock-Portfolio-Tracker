## Features
- **Add/Remove Stocks**: Easily add new stocks to your portfolio or remove existing ones.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches real-time stock prices using the `yfinance` library.
- **Performance Tracking**: Calculates current value, total investment, and profit/loss for each stock.
- **Portfolio Overview**: View all stocks in your portfolio along with relevant financial details such as buy price, current price, and gain/loss percentage.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Update your portfolio with the latest stock prices at any time.

## How It Works
- **Stock Data**: The application uses the Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance`) to fetch real-time stock prices.
- **Portfolio Management**: Users can manage their stock portfolio by adding and removing stocks, specifying the number of shares, and the price they purchased at.
- **Performance Metrics**: It calculates key metrics such as the total invested value, current market value, and profit/loss percentage for each stock in the portfolio.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-portfolio-tracker.git
   cd stock-portfolio-tracker
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

   You need to install the required libraries before running the application. This project uses Python 3.x and the following libraries:
   
   - `yfinance`
   - `pandas`

   Install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas
   ```

3. **Ensure Python is installed**:
   Make sure you are using Python 3.x. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:

   Once the dependencies are installed, run the `stock_portfolio_tracker.py` script:

   ```bash
   python stock_portfolio_tracker.py
   ```

2. **Adding a Stock**:

   When prompted, you can add a stock to your portfolio by providing:
   - Ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
   - Number of shares.
   - The price at which you bought the stock.

3. **Viewing and Updating Portfolio**:

   - View the current state of your portfolio, including real-time updates on current stock prices and profit/loss.
   - Update the portfolio at any time to fetch the latest stock data and recalculate the performance metrics.

4. **Removing a Stock**:

   You can remove any stock from the portfolio by providing its ticker symbol.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how the portfolio tracker works:

```python
# Adding stocks
tracker.add_stock("AAPL", 10, 150)  # Adds 10 shares of AAPL bought at $150
tracker.add_stock("TSLA", 5, 700)   # Adds 5 shares of TSLA bought at $700

# Viewing the portfolio
tracker.view_portfolio()

# Updating the portfolio with real-time stock prices
tracker.update_portfolio()

# Removing a stock
tracker.remove_stock("AAPL")
```

## Future Enhancements
Some ideas for future development:
- **Multiple Portfolios**: Support for tracking multiple portfolios.
- **Historical Data**: Track and visualize the historical performance of the portfolio over time.
- **Export Reports**: Add functionality to export portfolio performance to CSV or Excel.
- **API Integration**: Integrate with more financial data providers like Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud for better accuracy.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to save and load their portfolio for future sessions.
